# ⛵🐕 Wayfinder

**A desktop file indexer and organizer with AI-powered semantic search and Git integration**

Built with Tauri 2.0 + React + Rust | by NautiDog

---

## ✨ Features

### 📁 File Scanning & Indexing
- Recursively scan directories to build a searchable file index
- Filter by file types (Markdown, Python, JavaScript, Documents, etc.)
- Fast Rust-powered indexing with progress tracking
- Persistent index storage for quick reload

### 🧠 Azure OpenAI Embeddings
- Generate semantic embeddings for all your files using Azure OpenAI
- Smart caching - only re-embeds files that have changed
- Uses `text-embedding-3-small` model (5x cheaper than ada-002)
- Batch processing with progress indicators

### 🗂️ K-Means Clustering
- Automatically organize files into semantic clusters
- Pure Rust k-means implementation with cosine distance
- Discover related files you didn't know were connected
- Configurable cluster count

### 🔍 Hybrid Search
- Combine keyword and semantic search
- Adjustable semantic weight slider
- Ranked results with relevance scores
- File previews in search results

### 📅 Timeline View
- See files organized by modification date
- Configurable time range (7/14/30/90 days)
- Quick access to recently changed files

### 📎 Git Clippy Assistant
Your friendly git companion for ADHD developers!

- **Urgency Levels**: Chill → Nudge → Warning → Panic based on repo state
- **Smart Commit Suggestions**: Groups files by directory/extension with auto-generated messages
- **Duplicate Detection**: Finds identical files by content hash
- **Copy Pattern Detection**: Flags `_copy`, `_backup`, `_old` file naming
- **Days Since Commit**: Gentle reminders when it's been too long
- **Quick Actions**: 
  - WIP commit all changes
  - Create feature branch
  - Initialize new repo

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/) account (for embeddings)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AceOmni/wayfinder.git
cd wayfinder

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

### Configure Azure OpenAI

1. Copy the template config:
   ```bash
   cp azure_config.template.json .wayfinder_index/azure_config.json
   ```

2. Edit with your Azure credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "endpoint": "https://YOUR-RESOURCE.openai.azure.com",
     "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
     "deployment_name": "text-embedding-3-small",
     "api_version": "2024-02-01"
   }
   ```

3. Or configure directly in the app's Embeddings section.
